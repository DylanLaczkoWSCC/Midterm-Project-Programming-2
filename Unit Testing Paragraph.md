Unit testing involves testing individual units or components of code in isolation to ensure they function according to how the
developer planned for the code to work. By creating automated tests for small parts of the code, developers can catch bugs early, improve code maintainability, 
and refactor, document odd behavior, and promote better design practices in the future.
